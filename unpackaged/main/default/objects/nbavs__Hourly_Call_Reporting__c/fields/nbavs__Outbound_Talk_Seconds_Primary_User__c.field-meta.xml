    <description>The number of seconds spent talking on outbound calls which have been made by the User regardless of whether those calls connected or not. Note that calls to internal extensions that don&#39;t connect are also regarded as outbound calls. This statistic only records where the originator has not transferred the call, i.e. the originator actually dialled the initial call.</description>
